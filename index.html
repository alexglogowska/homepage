			<h2>The politeness theory Penelope Brown & Stephen C. Levinson</h2>
			<p>Politeness theory is a <a href="https://cotenfrontend.pl" target="_blank">sociolinguistic framework</a>
				developed by sociolinguists Penelope Brown and Stephen
				Levinson in the 1970s. It aims to explain how individuals manage and negotiate face-saving behaviour,
				social norms, and politeness in their interactions.
				The theory is based on the concept of face, which refers to a person's public self-image and their
				desire to maintain positive social interaction. Face can be seen as a universally important aspect of
				communication, as individuals in all cultures are concerned with preserving their own face and
				respecting the face of others.</p>

			<h2>The concept of ‘face’ by Erving Goffman 1967</h2>
			<p>
				In Goffman's framework, "face" refers to the public self-image that individuals strive to present to
				others in social interactions.
				The presentation of self, or the "face," involves carefully constructing one's behaviour, appearance,
				and verbal communication to maintain a desired image and uphold social expectations.</p>

			<h2>The two ‘faces’</h2>
			<p>
				Brown and Levinson distinguished between two aspects of the face: "positive face" and "negative face."
				Positive face refers to the desire for approval, affirmation, and recognition from others. It involves
				seeking acceptance and maintaining a sense of identity and self-worth.
				Negative face, on the other hand, relates to the desire for autonomy, independence, and freedom from
				imposition. It involves the desire to maintain one's freedom of action and avoid restrictions or
				obligations.</p>
